Epicodus Ping-Pong Challenge

Program interrogates a whole number greater than 1 and produces an array, starting with 0, of sequential numbers counting up to 
and including the whole number. For each instance of the resulting array where the number is divisible by 3, the program 
will write out "ping" in place of the number. For array numbers divisible by 5, the program will write out "pong" in place of the 
number. Array numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 will be replaced with "ping-pong".

To illustrate, the program would produce the following array for the number 20:

[0,1,2,ping,4,pong,ping,7,8,ping,pong,11,ping,13,14,ping-pong,16,17,ping,19,pong]
